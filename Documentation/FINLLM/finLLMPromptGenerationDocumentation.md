# Documentation for the Code

The prompt_generation.py is a Python script that generates prompts for stock market analysis and prediction based on relevant news and basic financial data.

## Dependencies

The code requires the following Python libraries to be installed:

- `os`
- `re`
- `csv`
- `math`
- `time`
- `json`
- `random`
- `finnhub`
- `pandas`
- `yfinance`
- `datetime`
- `collections`

You can install the required libraries using the `pip` package manager.

```
pip install finnhub pandas yfinance
```

## Usage

To use the code, follow these steps:

1. Import the required libraries:

```python
import os
import re
import csv
import math
import time
import json
import random
import finnhub
import pandas as pd
import yfinance as yf
import datetime
from collections import defaultdict
from .data_preparation import *
```

2. Define the start and end dates for the data:

```python
START_DATE, END_DATE = get_start_end_dates()
```

3. Set the data directory where the script will save the data:

```python
DATA_DIR = f"./{START_DATE}_{END_DATE}"
```

4. Implement the necessary functions to retrieve company information, prompts, and other utility functions as per your requirements.

5. Use the `get_prompt` function to generate prompts for a specific stock symbol:

```python
prompts = get_prompt("AAPL")
```

Note: Replace `"AAPL"` with the desired stock symbol.

The `get_prompt` function returns a list of prompts for stock market analysis and prediction. Each prompt includes information about the company, historical stock price movements, relevant news, and basic financials.

## Customization

You can customize the code to fit your specific needs. For example, you can modify the `get_prompt_by_row` function to include additional information in the prompts or change the format of the prompts.
