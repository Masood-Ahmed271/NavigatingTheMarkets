[Prediction & Analysis]:
Prediction: Down by 1-2%
Analysis: Given the potential concerns, such as the layoff of 5% of its workforce at Audible and the EU regulator blocking Amazon's acquisition of iRobot, the company's stock price could experience a slight decrease in the upcoming week. Additionally, the company's high debt levels could also be a concern for investors. However, the positive developments such as the increased price target by Bank of America and the expansion into APAC could potentially offset these concerns.

Overall, the prediction for the next week's stock price movement for Amazon is a downward trend by 1-2%. The company's recent layoff and regulatory challenges may impact the stock price in the short term. However, the company's strong focus on growth and the confidence of analysts suggest that the long-term outlook for the company remains positive.
